    <h2>Q5. Define Favicon and give an illustrative example.</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong>
        A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small, typically square image or icon associated with a website or web page. Favicons are displayed in various places, such as the browser's address bar, tabs, bookmarks, and browser history. They serve as a visual identifier for a website and help users quickly recognize and distinguish between different sites when multiple tabs or bookmarks are open.Here's an illustrative example of a favicon and how it's implemented in HTML:
<ol>
    <li>Favicon Image:

        Favicons are usually square icons with dimensions of 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels.
        They can be in various formats like .ico, .png, .gif, or .jpg, but .ico is the most common format.</li>
        <li>HTML Implementation:
            To include a favicon in your HTML document, you can use the "link" element within the "head" section of your HTML code</li>
</ol>
    </p>
</body>
